If you are looking for a reference lettre, feel free to ask by mail. I am currently only interested in remote jobs only.

As you may spotted, I did not give any home address. It was intentional because I do not want to leave a big Internet footprint. If you are interested to hire me, ask me any information by mail at <colin.bois@rocketmail.com>, I will reply shortly.

## My open project
I am currently working on only one open project for now :
 - [Autorace](https://github.com/clnbs/autorace) - A scalable racing game

## Previous experiences
In this section, I will explain what I did notable during my short career.

### Engineering school years
During my college year, I studied various computer science fields such as :
 - basic of Linux systems
 - basic of Java, Python, PHP among others
 - robotics software-side
 - OSI model mastery with an understanding of basic layer (TCP, UDP, PPP, ARP, SMTP, IMAP, HTTP, etc ...)
 - networking IPv4 mastery 
 - basic comprehension of IPv6
 - low level programming
 - a good knowledge of c/c++
 - mastery IoT programmation (full stack, from captors to data presentation)
 - team management on agile model (Kanban, SCRUM, etc ...) with tools (Gitlab, Redmine, etc ...)
 - coding good practice
 - graph theory
 - language theory
 - be a maker
 - artificial intelligence mastery with a certification delivery :
   - classification algorithms
   - regression algorithms
   - clustering algorithms
   - machine learning algorithms
   
All of those skills were tested during group project phases. Those projects were complex with brief deadlines in order to know if we were capable to handle stressful environment and still be able to fulfill requirements.

### Sunchain
My experience at Sunchain is, by far, the most satisfying employed job I got yet. Sunchain was full of challenges and deeply inspirational for me.  

> __While reading details about my Sunchain experience, you will have to keep in mind that I was the only computer scientist in the team.__
#### Sunchain project
The main goal was to share energy from a collectively built solar central between stakeholders. To achieve that goal, a consortium blocklchain was deployed to collect energy production and consumption in order to "split" renewable energy.

A future plan of roaming energy consumption via Sunchain's blockchain was in the pipeline.

#### My Sunchain missions
When I was hired, a basic prototype was built entirely in Go, but IT developments were out-sourced. My first mission then was to internalize all IT skill back in Sunchain in order to have a more agile project management that fitted the company's needs. Back then, I had never heard of containerization, neither high availability, micro-services nor Go and barely knew blockchain existed. I had to learn all by myself since I was the only IT expert in the team with close-to-no mentorship : the freelance who built the MVP system gave me tips from time to time. When I felt confident enough with my new skills, I was put in charge of cloud management and service availability. I was also in charge of writing technical solutions to clients in order to fulfill specification during all my employment.   

My second mission was to build a rescue service who computes energy splitting the same way smart-contracts (blockchain application) did in the blockchain and had to not rely on any existing system. Even if the coding style was far to be perfect, I was proud of it as it was my first ever company grade application.

My third mission was to develop a graphic interface for user to keep track of how much energy was generated, how energy was split, etc ... Since I am a bad designer, I out-sourced this development, but I was in charge of this user interface integration in our services, technical validation and security check.

My fourth mission was to get rid of Raspberry Pi who was issuing smart contract, wired as close to meters as possible. I did technological intelligence in order to get the best SoC possible with a strong security concern in mind. Once selecting done, I had to compile a custom Debian based distribution using Yocto Project. This experience made me dive deep in low level programming and Linux based operating systems which had a huge experience feedback, even if the learning curve could be painful sometime, especially since I was alone.
 
My fifth mission, linked to the fourth one, was to extend Sunchain connection capabilities to meter by developing wired and wireless connection to the gateway, depending on the field topography. I set up an in-house maintained LoRaWAN network for wireless communication and extend wire connection from USB to ModBus, RS-232 and in-house built multiplexing. The multiplexer was built by a co-worker, who was an electronic engineer, and I wrote its firmware, driver and API. The multiplexer was wired to several meters via RS-232 and to the gateway via an I2C connection. That part was really challenging since it was a new state-of-the-art in the IoT field with on-field updates, chaos monkey proof and high availability back-end; I am still really proud of this achievement.

My sixth and last mission at Sunchain was to change some of our technology stack in the DevOps field and use more of AWS services. Since Sunchain started to gain customers, and IT availability was in customer contract, I started to feel like an impostor and, at this time, I did not have enough confidence in myself and my technical skills. Moreover, at the same time, I was attending my engineering school and writing my engineering dissertation, it led me to heavy shift hours (about 12 to 14h per day, 8h during weekends) and get into a really stressful mind set. I also felt like I needed to do something for me and take some time to strengthen my knowledge. So I notified my manager and we hired a more experienced DevOps whom I formed in three months and he finally took over.

#### Summary
I learnt a lot in my Sunchain years in various IT fields. 

As an executive :
 - daily technological monitoring in several fields : open source projects (LoRaWAN by Brocaar, HyperLedger, Docker and Yocto Project), SoC, management and coding best practices, IoT and server clustering tools
 - made a system architecture for a cloud based application and evolving it
 - choice of the technology stack
 - product cycle management from a prototype to pre-industrial product
 
As a manager :
 - writing technical proposition for customers
 - be a source of proposals for Sunchain
 - manage trainees
 - manage a budget
 
As a developer :
 - management of the company's code base
 - infrastructure security
 - self learning
 - applying coding style and best practices
